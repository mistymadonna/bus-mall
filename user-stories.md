The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.



Marketing research team:  As a market researcher, I want to determine which 3 products are strong enough to get feedback from during a focus group so that we have a grasp of what items are most popular for BusMall. The team wants to not only know the total number of clicks but also item's percentage it was clicked when shown. The results will not be shown to participant until 25 clicks are done.


the developer: As a developer, I want to develop an app that successfully tracks how many times each image is displayed along with the total number of clicks and percentage so that the market research team has a grasp of the most popular items for BusMall. Once it hits, 25 clicks, the results will show a trend of most popular items and the user will be shown the results. Instead of showing immediate results, the goal is to put two buttons on the page: one that allows the participant to view the results, and another that allows the participant to vote 10 more times. Three items will be shown at a time with the user clicking on the one of each three they like the best.


focus group participant: As a focus group participant, I want to click on my favorite item out of three choices so that I can give good feedback to the market research team and for the developer's product to work.
