### User Stories (MVP)

- Marketing research team:  As a market researcher, I want to determine which 3 products are strong enough to get feedback from during a focus group so that we have a grasp of what items are most popular for BusMall.

- The developer: As a developer, I want to develop an app that successfully tracks how many times each image is displayed along with the total number of clicks and percentage so that the market research team has a grasp of the most popular items for BusMall.

- Focus group participant: As a focus group participant, I want to click on my favorite item out of three choices so that I can give good feedback to the market research team and for the developer's product to work.
